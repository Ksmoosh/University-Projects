It is a simple Microcontroller simulator, written in Python with a help of PyQt, which can handle few Assembler
language commands and also 10 chosen interruption functions.

Functions of 21H interrupt handler:

INT0:
    -closes application window
INT1:
    -waits for standard input and saves character's ASCII value to AL register
INT2:
    -reads value of register DL and writes the character that value represents (in ASCII code) to standard output,
     also moves that value to AL register
INT3:
    -launches new terminal window
INT6:
    -reads a command from the standard input device directly to terminal and runs it (careful with commands!)
INT2A:
    -sets registers with current date:
		- AL with number of day in the week (where 0 means Monday and 6 means Sunday),
		- BL with number of day,
		- BH with number of month,
		- CX with number of year
INT2C:
    -sets registers with current time:
        - AH with number of hours,
        - AL with number of minutes,
        - BH with number of seconds,
		- BL with number of milliseconds
INT30:
    -sets register AH with major system version and register AL with minor system version
INT49:
    -clears all registers in the program
INTED:
    -clears file used for saving and loading data
